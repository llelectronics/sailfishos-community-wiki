For community ports refer to the guidlines provided by the porter. Some can be found on the [libhybris porting list*](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/libhybris)


## Software / Apps on SailfishOS

SailfishOS provides by default a software center called Jolla Store.  
You can get native and android applications from there. Android applications are supported via [Alien Dalvik](aliendalvik.md)  
You need a Jolla Account for accessing the Jolla Store.

Unofficial Software repositories exists for SailfishOS. [Openrepos.net*](https://openrepos.net] is the biggest provider of unofficial applications. It provides its own application software center called [Storeman*](https://openrepos.net/content/osetr/storeman)

In order for installing applications not coming from the Jolla Store you need to activate **Allow untrusted software** from within the SailfishOS **settings** ->  **untrusted software** configuration menu.  
This will allow the installation of third party rpm and if Alien Dalvik is installed apk software packages.
