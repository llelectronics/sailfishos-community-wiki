# SailfishOS Download

SailfishOS can be officially downloaded as trial version for some Sony Xperia devices.  
You can find the download in the [Jolla Shop*](https://shop.jolla.com/)   
It is refered to the marketing term **Sailfish X** which is nothing else then SailfishOS for the Xperia devices supported and developed by Jolla.  
You can also find a paid version which provides text predictions, Microsoft Exchange support aswell as [Alien Dalvik](../installation/aliendalvik.md), which is an Android Runtime that allows you to run Android Applications.

There are **unofficial ports** available supported and developed by community members.
A list of most ports is available on the [libhybris wiki page*](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/libhybris)

*Libhybris* is the base which allows creating those Community ports for existing Android Smartphones.  
Jolla provides a [Hardware Adaptation Development Kit*](https://sailfishos.org/develop/hadk/) which eases the possibility to port SailfishOS to existing Android based devices. 

Developing SailfishOS Applications can be done with the official [SailfishOS SDK*](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Application_Development)
