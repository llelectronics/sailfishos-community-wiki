## What is SailfishOS

SailfishOS is a mobile operating system based on GNU/Linux and developed by [Jolla*](https://jolla.com).   
Its base Linux distribution core is called SailfishOS Core (formerly known as [Mer*](https://wiki.merproject.org)). 
Its major core is Linux Kernel.

SailfishOS runs on a couple of devices like. There are official Jolla devices that were released in the beginning of the development of SailfishOS. Then there is a cooperation with the [Sony Open Device Program*](https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/) to provide Images for a couple of Android released Sony devices. 
Jolla has other partners (like Inoi and JalaSoft) who ship phones preinstalled with SailfishOS or derivatives of SailfishOS. 

**Officially supported devices:**

* Jolla devices (Jolla Phone + Jolla C + Jolla Tablet)
* Sony Xperia devices (Xperia X, Xperia XA2)
* Inoi devices (R7)
* JalaSoft devices (Accione + Accione P)

## Localized SailfishOS versions

Jolla is marketing SailfishOS as being able to be localized for the given market. 
So far there exists a Russian adapted localized SailfishOS RUS version. 
It features some applications developed for the Russian market. 
Jollas licensing strategy makes it possible that developments in a localized version can be upstreamed after inspection and not being to specific to one particular market.
