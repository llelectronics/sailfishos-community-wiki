# SailfishOS Community Wiki

This is meant as a small community driven collection of tips and tricks for SailfishOS
The site is using Github and Markdown to keep it super simple. 
Links marked with a * are links to external websites.  
This stuff is meant to be moved to the community sfos.org docs as soon as possible
